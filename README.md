# MScA_Deep_Learning_Project

## Inspiration

The idea is that when the government or city is doing a new urban planning it is important for them to know the pattern and distribution of zones in existing cities or areas. We think by using the neural network, we can identify the zoning of satellite pictures and try a mapping to see the zoning patterns of cities.

## Data Description 

3666 small satellite images of the whole city of Austin and a csv file which relates the name of each of these images to the corresponding zoning tag.
